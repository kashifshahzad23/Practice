      The Royal Pakistan Air Force (RPAF) was established on 14 August 1947 with
      the independence of Pakistan from British India. <br />
      The RPAF began with a paper share allotment of 2,332 personnel, a fleet of
      24 Tempest II fighter-bombers, 16 Hawker Typhoon fighters,<br />
      two H.P.57 Halifax bombers, two Auster aircraft, twelve North American
      Harvard trainers and ten de Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes.<br />
      Very few were available to the RPAF on the ground as they were scattered
      throughout the British India to be given and collected later on.<br />
      Of these very few were in flyable condition so that they could be used.
      Subsequently,<br />
      it also got eight C-47 Dakota cargo planes which it used to transport
      supplies to soldiers fighting in the 1947 War in Kashmir against India.<br />
      First two H.P.57 Halifax bombers were delivered in 1948 and were used
      during 1947 War for night-time supply drop missions at Skardu and other
      northern areas of Pakistan.<br />
      All received against allotted at the time of independence of Pakistan from
      British India.<br />
      It started with seven airbases scattered all over the provinces. In 1949,
      Pakistan Air Force bombed the Afghan sponsored militant camps in border
      areas including an Afghan village to curb an unrest led by Ipi Faqir
      propagating independent Pashtunistan.<br />
      Border clashes with Afghanistan were reported in 1949–50 for the first
      time. In 1953–54, the Pakistan Air Force led an operation from Miramshah
      airbase and heavily bombarded Faqir Ipi's headquarter in Gurwek

    <p>
      The Pakistan Navy came into existence on 14 August 1947 with the
      establishment of Pakistan as an independent state from the United
      Kingdom.[22]<br />
      The Armed Forces Reconstitution Committee (AFRC), under Field Marshal Sir
      Claude Auchinleck, the last British Commander-in-Chief,<br />
      India (C-in-C, India), divided the shares and assets of the Royal Indian
      Navy (RIN) between India and Pakistan in a ratio of 2:1,[23]: conts. <br />
      with Pakistan receiving the two sloops, two frigates, four minesweepers,
      two naval trawlers and four harbour launches.[24]: 45–46 <br />
      The Armed Forces Reconstitution Committee (AFRC) allocated about
      two-thirds of the assets of the Royal Indian Navy to India while one third
      was given to the new Dominion of Pakistan,<br />
      despite Pakistan having inherited the high percentage of delta areas on
      its coast and the large maritime area covering the Arabian sea on the West
      and the Bay of Bengal on the East.[25]: 90  In addition,<br />
      India also objected to transfer any machinery at the Bombay Dockyard to
      Pakistan and further refused to part the machinery that happened to be on
      its soil.[26]: 90

    <h3 id="army">ARMY</h3>
    <p>
      At the time of the partition of British India, British Field Marshal
      (United Kingdom) Sir Claude Auchinleck favored the transfer of the
      infantry divisions to the Pakistan Army including the 7th,<br />
      8th and 9th.: 55 [31] In 1948, the British army officers in the Pakistan
      Army established and raised the 10th, 12th, and the 14th infantry
      divisions— with the 14th being established in East Bengal.: 55 [31] In
      1950,<br />
      the 15th Infantry Division was raised with the help from the United States
      Army, followed by the establishment of the 15th Lancers in
      Sialkot.: 36 [32]<br />
      Dependence on the United States grew furthermore by the Pakistan Army
      despite it had worrisome concerns to the country's
      politicians.: 36 [32]<br />
      Between 1950 and 1954, Pakistan Army raised six more armoured regiments
      under the U.S. Army's guidance: including, 4th Cavalry, 12th Cavalry, 15th
      Lancers,<br />
      and 20th Lancers.: 36 [32]
